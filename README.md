# Front End Developer Coding Test

The aim of this test is to see how you go about solving the problem. We will use it as the basis of a discussion in the next interview stage.

Ideally we would like to see it built using ReactJS, but if you donâ€™t have experience using react and would prefer to do it with vanilla JS then go ahead

The only criteria is to create a small app to run in the browser that can fetch and display a grid of lessons no more than 4 items wide from the following API:

Feel free to be as creative as you like with it.

Some ideas of things to think about, if you get the time:

- Accessibility
- Filtering
- Paging
- Sorting
- Testing
